# springviz

I challenged myself to create at least one visualization for each day of spring break, practicing how to create strong visualizations that communicate a storng message. Further, the data will vary from day-to-day but I may have a consistent theme of data for some days. The data will come from many different sources, I will make sure to put a readme under each folder to cite the data source.

I will mainly do all parts of this on R, but I may try to use Python to create some visualizations! If I have the will, I will try using D3 on JavaScript!
